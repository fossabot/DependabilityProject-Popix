<h1>Pop!x – Test Coverage and Mutation Analysis</h1>

<p>
    This page documents the evolution of <strong>test quality metrics</strong> for the Pop!x project.
    Static analysis artifacts are published via <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> to ensure transparency
    and reproducibility.
</p>

<!-- ===================== JACOCO ===================== -->

<h2>JaCoCo – Code Coverage Evolution</h2>

<p>
    Code coverage reports are generated using <strong>JaCoCo</strong> and illustrate how coverage
    evolves as different testing strategies are introduced (unit and integration testing).
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="jacoco/baseline/index.html">Baseline coverage</a>
        – Initial state before testing activities
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="jacoco/after-unit-tests/index.html">After unit tests</a>
        – Coverage after unit-level testing (model and service layers)
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="jacoco/after-integration-tests/index.html">After integration tests</a>
        – Coverage including presentation and persistence flows
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="jacoco/final/index.html">Final coverage</a>
        – Consolidated project coverage
    </li>
</ul>

<!-- ===================== PITEST ===================== -->

<h2>PiTest – Mutation Testing Campaign</h2>

<p>
    Mutation testing was conducted using <strong>PiTest</strong> to evaluate the effectiveness
    of the unit test suite in detecting injected faults.
    Due to its computational cost, mutation analysis was executed as a dedicated campaign
    rather than as part of the continuous integration pipeline.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="pitest/baseline/pit-reports/index.html">Baseline mutation analysis</a>
        – Initial mutation testing campaign
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="pitest/final/pit-reports/index.html">Final mutation analysis</a>
        – Consolidated mutation testing results after test evaluation
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>
    Both coverage and mutation analysis include only project-owned code and intentionally exclude
    third-party libraries and framework-dependent components to ensure meaningful and academically
    valid metrics.
